Mastermind-Game

Welcome to the classic game of Mastermind! This project is a web-based implementation of the popular code-breaking game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play

Mastermind is a game of logic and deduction. The objective is to guess the secret code, which is a sequence of colored pegs chosen by the computer. The code consists of a series of pegs, each with a color. There are usually four pegs in the code, but this can vary depending on the game settings.

Rules

The codebreaker (you) tries to guess the secret code by placing colored pegs in a row.
After each guess, the codemaker (computer) provides feedback in the form of black and white pegs:

A black peg indicates a correct color in the correct position.

A white peg indicates a correct color but in the wrong position.

No peg indicates that the color is not present in the secret code.

Using this feedback, the codebreaker refines their guesses until they crack the code or run out of attempts.


How to Play

Open index.html in your web browser.

Click on the colored pegs to make your guess.

After each guess, review the feedback provided by the computer.

Continue guessing until you either crack the code or exhaust your attempts.
